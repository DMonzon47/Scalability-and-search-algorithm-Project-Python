# Scalability-problem-solving-and-search-algorithm-Project-Python. Grade achieved : 94%
Scalability and search algorithms (Python):
•	Creation of a data set, to tackle given problems with own python algorithm, and analysis with developed search algorithm (linear and binary search). 
•	Explaining the scalability, complexity and benchmarking of my code, tested against instances of problems.
•	Presented all findings in a technical report with various visualisation techniques.
